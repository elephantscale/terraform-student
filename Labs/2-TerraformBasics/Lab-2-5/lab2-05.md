# Lab 2-5

### Overview
In this lab, you will create an EC2 instance in two different regions by using the data aws_instance construct to find the right ami

By using two different providers, one for the default us-east-2 and a named provider for us-east-1, you can use the same code to deploy an ubuntu instance in each region

## Depends On
YOu can reuse your providers file and the standard aws_instance definition we have been using so far

### Run time
15-20 minutes (est)

### Step One - Setting up the providers

* Recall from the example that we add a new provider block in the provders.tf file.  Set the region of the new provider to "us-east-1" and set its alias property to whatever string you want. In the example, we used the name "Viginia"

### Step Two - Setting up the search

* We need two data resources, one in us-east-1 and another in us-east-2 to find the ami id in each region. To make sure that the data resource looks in the right region, the one searching us-east-1 should use the named provider.
* Aside from the addition of the provider, the code for these two data blocks is exactly the same, and of course the name we give the blocks need to be different

### Step Three - Defining the instances

* We can use the same aws_instance code we have been using. However, the instance in us-east-1 should have the provider argument provided.  
* For each machine, we can provide the id for ami that the data block found


### Step Four - Execute 

* Deploy the resource with _terraform_apply_
* Verify the results in the AWS console -- be sure to check both regions
* Run _terraform destroy_


### Done
