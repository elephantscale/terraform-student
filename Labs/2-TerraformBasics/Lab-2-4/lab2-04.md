# Lab 2-4

### Overview
In this lab, you are going experiment with using a template file

A sample solution is provided in the solution directory - __Your solution may be different.__  The solution provided is intended as a guide, not a "right" answer

You should try to see if you can write the code without looking at the solution provided; however you may want to follow the solution when writing your code if you need an example to follow


### Depends On
The code you wrote from lab 2-3.  You may want to delete code that is not used in your solution to this lab

### Run time
15-20 minutes (est)

### Step One - Coding

* Delete the local variable "name" and all the output definitions
* Add a local variable called "developer" with whatever value strikes your fancy 
* Create a local text file called _document.txt_ with an unquoted line of text
    - For example: _This file belongs to ${myname}_
    - Ensure you have the "myname" slot included like in the line above
* Use the _templatefile(template, args)_ to read in the file to a local variable _documentation_
    = _documentation = templatefile("document.txt", {myname = local.developer})
* In the _outputs.tf_ file:
    - Create output variable that prints out the documentation variable you created

* Change the Name of the EC2 instance to something like "Zippy's Machine" where Zippy would be the name specified in _local.developer_

### Step Two - Execute 

* Run _terraform init_
* Run _terraform validate_
* Run _terraform plan_
* Run _terraform apply_
* Verify the results in the AWS console
* Run _terraform destroy_


### Done
