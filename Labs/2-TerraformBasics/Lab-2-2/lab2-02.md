# Lab 2-2

### Overview
In this lab, you are going to replace the hardcoded values in the code from the last lab with variables

A sample solution is provided in the solution directory - __Your solution may be different.__  The solution provided is intended as a guide, not a "right" answer

You should try to see if you can write the code without looking at the solution provided; however you may want to follow the solution when writing your code if you need an example to follow


### Depends On
The code you wrote from lab 2-1

### Run time
15-20 minutes (est)

### Step One - Coding

* Delete the s3 bucket resource
* Create a _variables.tf_ file that:
    - Contains a variable named _ami_type_ which is of type string and has a default value the same as the hard-coded value you used in the last lab (ami-077e31c4939f6a2f3)
    - Contains a variable named _inst_type_ which is of type string and does not have a default value
* In the _main.tf_ file:
    - Replace the hardcoded ami string with _var.ami_type_
    - Replace the hardcoded instance type string with _var.inst_type_
* Add an _outputs.tf_ file that contains three outputs:
    - The value of the EC2 instance ami attribute
    - The value of the EC2 instance type attribute
    - The value of the EC2 instance public ip address (you may have to look this up)
    

### Step Three - Execute without a _terraform.tfvars_ file

* Run _terraform init_
* Run _terraform validate_
* Run _terraform plan_
    - Notice that you are prompted to supply the value for the _inst_type_ variable
* Run _terraform apply_
* Verify the results in the AWS console
* Run _terraform destroy_

### Step Four - Execute with a _terraform.tfvars_ file

* Create a _terraform.tfvars_ file and add the line
    inst_type = "t2.nano"
* Run _terraform validate_
* Run _terraform plan_
    - Notice that you are __not__ prompted to supply the value for the _inst_type_ variable
* Run _terraform apply_
* Verify the results in the AWS console
* Run _terraform destroy_

### Done

* Save your work, you will be modifying it in the next lab
