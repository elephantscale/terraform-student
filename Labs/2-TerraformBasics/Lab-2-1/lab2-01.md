# Lab 2-1

### Overview
In this lab, you are going to create some basic resources with hardcoded values.

A sample solution is provided in the solution directory - __Your solution may be different.__  The solution provided is intended as a guide, not a "right" answer

You should try to see if you can write the code without looking at the solution provided; however you may want to follow the solution when writing your code if you need an example to follow


### Depends On
You can reuse some of the code from the hello world lab you did at the start of the course

### Run time
15-20 minutes (est)

### Step One - Coding

* Create a folder for your root module
* Add a providers.tf file that:
    - Contains a _terraform_ block that has AWS as a required provider
    - Contains a _provider_ block that has your profile and the region "us-east-2"
    - If you use a different region, you will need to change the _ami_ since they have different ids in different regions
* Add a _main.tf_ file that:
    - Create an EC2 instance with:
        - The ami = ami-077e31c4939f6a2f3
        - The instance type should be "t2.nano"
        - The Name tag should be set to "Lab 2-1"
    - Create an S3 bucket
        - Ensure that you give it a unique name 

### Step Three - Execute and test

* Run _terraform init_
* Run _terraform validate_
* Run _terraform plan_
* Run _terraform apply_
* Verify the results in the AWS console
* Run _terraform destroy_

### Done

* Save your work, you will be modifying it in the next lab
