# Lab 2-3

### Overview
In this lab, you are going experiment with reading from a file, using local variables and string interpolation

A sample solution is provided in the solution directory - __Your solution may be different.__  The solution provided is intended as a guide, not a "right" answer

You should try to see if you can write the code without looking at the solution provided; however you may want to follow the solution when writing your code if you need an example to follow


### Depends On
The code you wrote from lab 2-2.  You may want to delete code that is not used in your solution to this lab

### Run time
15-20 minutes (est)

### Step One - Coding

* Create a text file called "name.txt". It should contain a single line of text which will be the name of your instance
* Create a local variable called name that reads in the contents of the text file
* Use the local variable "name" to set the Name tag of myVM  
* In the _outputs.tf_ file:
    - Create an output variable that prints out "Hi my name is ___" where "___" is Name tag value from myVM. You need to use string interpolation to do this
    - The Name tag attribute from the EC2 machine is accessed by
    - *aws_instance.myVM.tags.Name*
    

### Step Two - Execute 

* Run _terraform init_
* Run _terraform validate_
* Run _terraform plan_
* Run _terraform apply_
* Verify the results in the AWS console
* Run _terraform destroy_


### Done

* Save your work, you will be modifying it in the next lab
