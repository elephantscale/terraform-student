# Lab 3-4

### Overview
In this lab, you are going to experiment with terraform workspaces

For this lab and several that follow, the emphasis will not be on writing terraform code but on understanding how terraform uses state

### Depends On
The starting code for this lab is in the solutions folder for lab 3-1 but you can delete one of the VMs to make the running of the terraform code go faster

### Run time
15-20 minutes (est)

### Step One - Creating the default deployment

* To keep track of your machines, change the name of the EC2 instance to "default" since it will be deployed in the default workspace
* Run _terraform apply_ and verify that you have the an EC2 machine correctly created
* Look in the local directory and note that you have a single statefile

### Step Two - Creating a new workspace

* Use the _terraform workspace new dev_ command to create a development workspace
* To confirm you are in the dev workspace, run _terraform workspace list_ and ensure the "*" appears next to "dev"
* Change the name tag of the EC2 code so that the deployed machine will have the name "Development"
* Run _terraform apply_ and notice that a new instance appears, and the one your previously deployed is unaffected.
* Check your local directory and notice that there is now a directory that holds a new copy of a state file corresponding to to your new workspace 

### Step Three - Removing the deployment from the dev workspace

* If you switch workspaces back to the default workspace and run _plan_ terraform will use the statefile for the default workspace which is now out of sync with the source code
* Switch back to the dev workspace and run _plan_ again. No changes are required because terraform is now using the dev workspace state file that _is_ in sync with the source code
* Run terraform  destroy and remove the dev workspace deployment

### Step Four - Remove the deployment from the default workspace

* Switch back to the default workspace
* Run terraform destroy to remove the default deployment
* Confirm visually in the console that both deployments are now removed


### Done
