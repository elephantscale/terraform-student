# Lab 3-4

### Overview
In this lab, you will implement a S3 remote state backend

Once you are finished this lab, you will have the option of using the bucket you set up for all the rest of your work or continue using a local back end


### Run time
15-20 minutes (est)

### Step One - Creating the S3 bucked

* There are two directories in the solution. The one labelled "backend" has the code to set up the S3 remote backend.  The other, labelled "code", contains an EC3 instance resource that will use the S3 backend
* Go into the backend directory
* In the s3 bucket definition, you need to supply a unique name for the bucket.
* In production we would enable both versioning and prevent-delete, but this just makes it harder to clean up after the lab so we disable them
* You also need to provide a unique name for the lock table
* Once this is done, run terraform apply and then verify at the console that the bucket was created

### Step Two - Using the s3 backend

* Go to the code directory and open up the providers.tf file.
* You will notice that there is the code to configure this module to use the backend you set up
* Ensure the names of the locktable and bucket are the same as the ones you created in step one
* Replace "myproj" with your own key value. This is used in the bucket to uniquely identify the state for this module
* Run terraform apply
* Examine the bucket to see your state file

### Step Three - Reverting to a local back end

* To stop using the S3 backend, remove the backend code from the providers.tf file in the code directory
* Run terraform init and terraform will transfer the state files down to your local directory

### Step Four - Clean up the resources

* GO to the S3 console and delete the contents of your bucket
* Run terraform destroy in the backend directory to remove the remote backen bucket and lock table
### Done
