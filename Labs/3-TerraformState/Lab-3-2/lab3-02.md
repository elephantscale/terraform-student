# Lab 3-2

### Overview
In this lab, you are going to experiment with terraform state commands

For this lab and several that follow, the emphasis will not be on writing terraform code but on understanding how terraform uses state

### Depends On
The starting code for this lab is in the solutions folder for lab 3-1

### Run time
15-20 minutes (est)

### Step One - Setting up

* Using the same code you started the last lab with
* Run _terraform apply_ and verify that you have the two instances "X" and "Y" running

### Step Two - Removing a resource from terraform control

* Run the _terraform state list_ command to see that you have two instances under terraform control
* Run the command _terraform state show aws_instance.X_ to see a full specification of the AWS resource
* Run the command _terraform state rm aws_instance.X_
* Run the command _terraform state list_ to verify that "X" is no longer under terraform control
* Check the AWS console to verify that the AWS resource was _not_ destroyed
* Run _terraform plan_ to see that terraform no longer can see the running resource and will now create a new one to satisfy the requirement of the *tf file
* __Don't run apply just yet -- only plan__

### Step Three - Importing the resource

* The import command allows us to bring any existing resource under terraform control
* We do need to have a terraform specification that matches the attributes of the resource
    - We have that in aws_instance.X 
* Go to the AWS console and copy the instance ID of "X"
* Execute the command _terraform import aws_instance.X <<instance id of X>>_
* Run _terraform state list_ to verify


### Step Four - Renaming a resource

* Create a copy of the terraform code for the aws_instance.X and call it aws_instance.Z
  - Also change the Name from "X" to "Z"
  


### Step Five - Non-destructive changes

* In some cases, if we change the description of a resource in the *tf file, terraform can make the change "in place" by modifying the existing resource
* In your definition of instance "X", change the instance type to a "t2.nano"
    - Run _terraform apply_ and notice that terrform changes the existing instance
    - This is like terraform unplugging a hard drive from one computer and plugging it back into a different computer
    
### Step Six - Destructive Changes

* In some cases, the changes specified cannot be applied to the existing resource. In this case, terraform destroys the old resource and creates a new one that matches the changed specification
* The current ami in the example is an Amazon Linux 2 instance with an ami = "ami-077e31c4939f6a2f3"
* Change the definition of instance "X" to use an Ubuntu image with an ami = "ami-00399ec92321828f5"
* Run _terraform apply_ and notice that terraform has to recreate the instance.
  
### Cleanup 
* Run _terraform destroy_
* Change the ami for instance X back to "ami-077e31c4939f6a2f3"
* Change the instance type back to "t2.micro"

### Done

* Save your work, you will be modifying it in the next lab
