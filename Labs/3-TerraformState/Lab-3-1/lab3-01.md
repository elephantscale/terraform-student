# Lab 3-1

### Overview
In this lab, you are going to experiment with terraform state

For this lab and several that follow, the emphasis will not be on writing terraform code but on understanding how terraform uses state

### Depends On
The starting code for this lab is in the solutions folder

### Run time
15-20 minutes (est)

### Step One - Setting up

* Go to your AWS console and in US-EAST-2, create an EC2 instance and name it "External".
    - This instance is outside terraform control
    - The reason for creating this instance is to show that since it is not known to terraform, it will be unaffected by all of the activities of this lab
* Run _terraform apply_ and verify that you have the two instances "x" and "Y" running

### Step Two - Removing a definition from terraform

* Recall that your *tf files are __your__ directions to terraform as to what actions to take
* Comment out the definition of instance "X"
* Run terraform apply and notice that terraform removes the instance from AWS to satisfy the requirements of the edited tf file
* Uncomment out the definition and run _terraform apply_ again notice that terraform recreates the AWS resource to satisfy the requirements of the source code.

### Step Three - Removing a resource from AWS

* For this step, go to the AWS console and terminate the instance "X" manually
* Run _terraform apply_ and notice terraform sees the instance is missing and recreates it

### Step Four - Modifying an instance

* Ensure that your instance "X" is up and running
* Change the Name to something other than "X"
* Run _terraform apply_ and notice that terraform has realized that what is now running does not match what is in the source code
* Terraform changes the Name back to "X"


### Step Five - Non-destructive changes

* In some cases, if we change the description of a resource in the *tf file, terraform can make the change "in place" by modifying the existing resource
* In your definition of instance "X", change the instance type to a "t2.nano"
    - Run _terraform apply_ and notice that terrform changes the existing instance
    - This is like terraform unplugging a hard drive from one computer and plugging it back into a different computer
    
### Step Six - Destructive Changes

* In some cases, the changes specified cannot be applied to the existing resource. In this case, terraform destroys the old resource and creates a new one that matches the changed specification
* The current ami in the example is an Amazon Linux 2 instance with an ami = "ami-077e31c4939f6a2f3"
* Change the definition of instance "X" to use an Ubuntu image with an ami = "ami-00399ec92321828f5"
* Run _terraform apply_ and notice that terraform has to recreate the instance.
  
### Cleanup 
* Run _terraform destroy_
* Change the ami for instance X back to "ami-077e31c4939f6a2f3"
* Change the instance type back to "t2.micro"

### Done

* Save your work, you will be modifying it in the next lab
